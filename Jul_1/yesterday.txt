Yesterday was our first day
we started to install git hub and learn git clone, git add, git commit, git push
we do some exerxise.
After classes, I do some exercise at home with my friends and I try to remember back what we do on the classes yesterday.
I think i can catch up a little bit but then I just sleep and continue back on the early morning before going to classes so that I can answer a little bit of the quiz that sir give for us.
